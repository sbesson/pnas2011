Readme
======

This repository contains data and scripts allowing to reproduce the figures of
[Universal rule for the symmetric division of plant cells](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1011866108).

Prerequisites
-------------

*   MATLAB version R2007a or later
*   the API allowing to read the cell structures available at

Files
-----

Raw images used for performing the cell division analysis are available on request.

This repository contains

*   the results of the analysis of dividing cells for multiple systems saved as MAT files e.g. [dionaea_results.mat](dionaea_results.mat).

*   the scripts used to produce the figures and movies of the publication
