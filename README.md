Readme
======

This repository contains data and scripts allowing to reproduce the figures of
[Universal rule for the symmetric division of plant cells](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1011866108).

Prerequisites
-------------

*   MATLAB version R2007a or later
*   the API allowing to read the cell structures available at
    https://github.com/sbesson/plant-tissue/releases/tag/v0.1.0

Files
-----

Raw images used for performing the cell division analysis are available on request.

The results of the analysis of dividing cells are saved as MAT files, named after each system e.g. [dionaea_results.mat](dionaea_results.mat).

The [Figure6.m](Figure6.m) script allows to reproduce the [Figure 6](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/15/6294#F6) of the paper.
